Turn these tasks into GitHub Issues (?)
Ericka will focus on the front-end design, and I will focus on the back-end.

Schedule:
April 20 3-7pm is the Leadership Pasadena Demo

- The database needs to be using the correct fields.
- Addresses need to be fully formed.
- Categories need to be set.
- Some items have P.O. Boxes only.
- Phone number format needs to be the same for every service.
- Description could be longer, like in the Pasadena survival guide?

- Add hours field.
- Get it working in IE.

User Interface TODO:
- User authentication, admin, member, logged in user, guest
- In Desktops with a certain large aspect ratio, the list should be on the left side of the screen, always displayed.
- Each category needs a unique icon.
- Multiple services at a single location need to be handled in the map.
- When an info window is active, opening the list should scroll to the corresponding service.
- When searching or choosing a category, the map should zoom to the extents of the search items.
- Don't use svg, but gif instead.

Email Ericka (erickakoyama@gmail.com) to meet after the 20th, some day at 5:30?. We can discuss:
- Where to put the code. (github.com/io is great)
- What framework to use.
- The interface design.
- What type of database. (don't use .csv (change to .txt?))
